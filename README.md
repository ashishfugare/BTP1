Review and Implementation of Heuristic Search Methods for
Solving Cryptoarithmatic Problems

Abstract

This thesis explores heuristic search methods for solving Cryptarithmetic problems, focusing
on the implementation and evaluation of Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) techniques.
Cryptarithmetic problems are mathematical puzzles where digits are represented by letters of
the alphabet, posing a significant challenge for computational algorithms. Traditional brute-
force methods quickly become unmanageable as the problem size increases, leading to
inefficiencies in time and space complexity. Our study leverages the inherent constraints
within these puzzles to reduce the search space and enhance computational efficiency. We
review existing literature on heuristic search methods and implement various algorithms to
analyze their performance. Our experiments demonstrate that the heuristic CSP method
significantly outperforms the brute-force approach, yielding faster and more effective
solutions. This research aims to contribute to the field by providing a more efficient approach
to solving Cryptarithmetic problems, especially as the size and complexity of the problems
increase.
